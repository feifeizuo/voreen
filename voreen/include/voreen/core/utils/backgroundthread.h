 * Worker thread for a processor, automatically invalidates processor when finished.

 *  before invalidating the processor, which otherwise would lead to deadlock. The same goes for calling the destructor within process()
 *  (as it contains an implicit join()) and interruptAndJoin(), because the interrupt signal might arrive at the thread
 *  when computation is finished and the thread will not be interrupted before trying to lock the mutex.
