# Voreen - The Volume Rendering Engine

Voreen is an open source rapid application development framework for the interactive visualization 
and analysis of multi-modal volumetric data sets. It provides GPU-based volume rendering and data 
analysis techniques and offers high flexibility when developing new analysis workflows in 
collaboration with domain experts. The Voreen framework consists of a multi-platform C++ library, 
which can be easily integrated into existing applications, and a Qt-based stand-alone application. 
It is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.

The Voreen project has been initiated and was originally maintained by the Visualization & Computer 
Graphics Research Group at the University of Münster as part of the collaborative research center 
SFB 656 MoBil (Project Z1, Project Ö). Since 2018, Voreen has been collaboratively developed by the Pattern 
Recognition and Image Analysis (PRIA) Research Group and the VISualization & graphIX (VISIX) Research Group.
Since October 2024, development has moved to github to enable contributions from the public.

Note: This project is being continuously populated from the original [project website](http://voreen.uni-muenster.de).
